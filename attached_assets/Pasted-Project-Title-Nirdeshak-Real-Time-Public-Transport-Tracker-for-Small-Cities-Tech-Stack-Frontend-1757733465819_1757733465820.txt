📌 Instructions for Generator:
“Generate a responsive web dashboard in React + TailwindCSS with a sidebar, card-based KPIs, charts, and live map widgets. Include the unique features mentioned (3D map, crowdsourced GPS, CO₂ savings, SOS safety). Design should look modern, clean, and optimized for judges’ presentation in SIH. Avoid copying railway dashboards — make it unique with sustainability + safety focus.”
